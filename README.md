# Project Title: GenericApp

**Name**: Jesse Jittan  
**Course**: Software Development I  
**CRN**: CEN-3024C-14320

## Project Description
Develop a system that uses Java Generics to handle different types of data. Use your favorite movie or TV as inspiration for the type of data you will collect, and what basic operations will be performed on thedata.  Come up with your own inspiration, and three classes that you can write that are related to it. Each class must collect atleast 3 attributes, using a mixture of data types.

The system should be capable of performing basic operations like adding, removing, and retrieving data. The type of data can be anything (e.g., numbers, strings, custom objects), and your system should be flexible enough to handle any data type. 

### Important Concepts and Tools
- **Generics**: The project makes extensive use of Java generics, allowing classes and methods to operate on various data types while maintaining type safety.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are employed to create a robust and maintainable codebase.
- **Collections Framework**: Utilizes Javaâ€™s collections framework to manage and manipulate groups of objects.

### Expected Inputs and Outputs
- **Program Objective**: demonstrates GenericContainer functionality with Game of Thrones houses:
    House Stark, House Targaryen, and House Lannister.
- Creating and adding instances to GenericContainers
- Printing container contents
- Sorting containers by different attributes
- Removing and retrieving items
- Printing container sizes
